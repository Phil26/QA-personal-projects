This is a demo mini-project in which I used JIRA test management tool to exploring  the agile testing aproach.

"DealMart" folder contains:

* Agile_Structure.xlsx                  -  in this Excel file can be found the product backlog, the sprint planning, the test cases, and the evidence of tasks for development team                                            as well as for QA team members.
                                        - this files is a kind of backup for implemented concepts in JIRA 

* DealMart_AgileProcess.pdf             - this .pdf file contains a brief summary of the activities executed using JIRA tool (must read).
